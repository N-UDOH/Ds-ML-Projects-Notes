# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using SVM

A machine learning project that uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify handwritten digits from the popular digits dataset.

## Project Structure

- Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_Using_SVM.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow
- README.md — Project overview and instructions
- app.py (to be added) — Streamlit web app for user interaction (coming soon)

##  Overview

This project:
- Visualizes handwritten digit data
- Trains an SVM classifier
- Evaluates performance with accuracy score and confusion matrix
- Tests predictions with user inputs

## Web Deployment

This project will be deployed as a *Streamlit web app*, where users can draw digits and get instant predictions.

## Future Work

- Add Streamlit front-end
- Enable webcam/canvas digit input
- Allow model selection
